WINDOWS
=======

Requirements
------------
Visual Studio 2015 (VC14):	https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/
CMake:				https://cmake.org/download/
Qt5:				https://www.qt.io/download-open-source/
SFML:				https://www.sfml-dev.org/download.php
GLEW:				http://glew.sourceforge.net/
Zlib:				http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/zlib.htm

When given the option, all libraries should be the 32-bit version. Zlib comes
either in an installer, or in zips. If you download the zips, you need to
decompress both the binaries and developer files into the same location.

Fixing Zlib
-----------
The Zlib build for Windows has a long-standing bug here:

https://sourceforge.net/p/gnuwin32/bugs/169/

To get it to compile properly, you'll need to edit include/zconf.h and change
the:

#if 1 /* HAVE_UNISTD_H

line to:

#ifdef HAVE_UNISTD_H

Cmake settings
--------------
Open the CMake GUI, set the source code directory to the folder containing this 
file, set the build directory to wherevery you like (I put a 'build' directory 
within the Tread Marks root folder) and press 'Configure'.

Set the compiler to Siausl Studio 2015, set the toolset to v140_xp, and press 
'Finish'.

It will fail to locate a bunch of libraries. Setting these values to the
appropriate root directories will help CMake find them:
* PATH_GLEW  (eg: D:\3rdParty\glew-2.0.0)
* PATH_QT    (eg: C:\Qt\5.7\msvc2015) (optional)
* PATH_SFML  (eg: D:\3rdParty\SFML-2.4.1)
* PATH_ZLIB  (eg: D:\3rdParty\zlib-1.2.3)
* PATH_UCRT  (eg: C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\10\Redist\ucrt\DLLs\x86) (optional)

Now when you click 'Configure' again, it should succeed with the message
"Configuring done". Now you can click the 'Generate' button. This will create a
'TreadMarks.sln' file in your build directory which you can open with Visual
Studio.

There's a couple projects in this solution:
* TM: This is the actual game.
* TreadMarks: This is the launcher.

There's some additional targets that are useful:
* FIXUP: This will copy all the necessary dependencies in order for you to run
         the project from Visual Studio. Just make sure you set the debugging
	 working directory to the "Resources" directory and you're all set to
	 debug.
* INSTALL: This will attempt to install all the necessary files to play the
           game into the final location. By default, it will be in the
	   "Program Files (x86)" folder, so you'll either need to run Visual
	   Studio as an administrator for this target to work, or change the
	   CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX variable in CMake.
* PACKAGE: If you have NSIS installed, this will create an installer.
* PACKAGE_AND_SIGN: If you have a digital certificate, and you set the CERT and
                    CERT_PASS variables in CMake, this will make a signed
		    installer.

OS X
====
Builds and launches, but currently there's a bug that makes all the textures magenta.

To get zlib and GLEW, the easiest way is with home-brew.

You can get Homebrew by running the following command on the command line:

ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)" < /dev/null 2> /dev/null

And then to install the libraries, run:

brew install glew
brew install lzlib

From here you can use cmake-gui as in the Windows build.

Linux
=====
I've ony tried to build a headless server so far. It might work, but so far
I've only tested the build with g++ 4.8, which crashes on startup because they
didn't fully implement c++ regular expression until 4.9.

To do that, you only need Zlib, and of course cmake and a compiler.
On Ubuntu, here's how you get your packages:

sudo apt-get install build-essential cmake zlib1g-dev

Or on RedHat it's:

sudo yum install gcc-g++ cmake zlib

Once you have all the pre-requisites, you can create the build script and build
it with:

mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=g++ -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS="-std=c++11" -DBUILD_HEADLESS=true ..
make
make install

Once everything is built, it should be copied into the 'out' directory.
