# Notes for translators:
#   %s represents a place where a word or phrase will be
#       placed into the line (eg: "Name: %s" might become
#       "Name: John Doe").
#   %d represents a place where a number will be placed
#       into the string (eg: "Ammo: %d" might become
#       "Ammo: 42")
